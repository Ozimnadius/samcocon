h4 WHAT TO CHOOSE eCommerce or Landing?
p Since 2021, every trading or dropshipping company has started selling online. As a result, every day, we record dozens of new trading platforms in different areas, differing in combination, functionality, and development strategy. So how do you determine which is better: an eCommerce or a landing page?
p To answer the question, define the following:
ul
    li product stocks and volume
    li target audience
    li whether the product will have assembling options
    li do customers make online payments, and what payment platform/service you prefer
    li do you plan to connect the calculation of delivery cost
    li are you planning to trade within one city or throughout the country/internationally?
    li how prices and stock balances will be updated?
    li is it intended to maintain a customer database and notify buyers about discounts and promotions?
    li whether the product has complex characteristics and descriptions?
p If your assortment line does not exceed 30 positions and the goal is to emphasize the product and its presentation, it is worth staying on the landing page. However, if you plan to use:
ul
    li product stock with more than 30 items
    li main sources of promotion are contextual advertising or social networks
    li a full-fledged advertising campaign using popular promotion channels
    li automate online trading
    li integration with payment system
    li separate calculation of delivery costs
    li synchronization with the customer base and stock balances in the warehouse
    li Then it is worth paying attention to creating an eCommerce since the fast and multifunctional resource is necessary for reliable branding and prompt response.
